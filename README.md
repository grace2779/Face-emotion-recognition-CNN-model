# Face-emotion-recognition-CNN-model
Machine learning CNN model (pre-trained on 1000) transfer learning Face Emotion Recognition

 Machine Learning models on the dataset to  and deploy it in  application which classifies the emotions using 7 categories. 
 
 FER_CNN.ipynb is the file in Jupyter Notebook with the results of training the model.
 FER_CNN_1.ipynb - the file in Jupyter Notebook where you upload the trained model and use in application for identify the emotions on the test image
 FER_CNN_2.ipynb - the file in Jupyter Notebook where you upload the trained model and use in application for identify the emotions on the test image
 
Retraining the model.

If you wish to retrain the model, please Open Anaconda prompt in this folder's location and use the following command to train the model again.

Command: python FER_CNN.py
